    <h1>More about CWB...</h1>
    <p>Welcome to CWB.World.  Our mission is to make solutions available for everyone.  

      We do this by collaborating with solution providers to make it easier for you to engage 
      
      with them and for them to engage with you.   You can engage at physical locations, from y
      
      our phone tablet or other smart device.  Our engagement model uses: group membership, 
      
      live video streaming, content libraries, learning management system and a network of satellite 
      
      locations to be where, when and how you want to engage.</p>
      <h3>And membership is free. Come in.</h3> 
     <h2> Welcome to the community.</h2>
